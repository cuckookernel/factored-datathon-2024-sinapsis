ev_id,"Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely identifies it in the master dataset.  NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is NOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields should be used for this.  NOTE: There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 and February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0 – these are not missing events, the ID sequence was simply reset at a higher number so that it is possible to easily distinguish events created after the switchover to GDELT 2.0 from those created using the older GDELT 1.0 system."
ev_date,Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.
a1_name,"The actual name of the Actor1.  In the case of a political leader or organization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a geographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES / PARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD, CATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc).  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1."
a1_country_code,The 3-character CAMEO code for the country affiliation of Actor1.  May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine its country affiliation (such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”).
a1_country_name, The country name after cameo code is matched
a1_type1_code,"The 3-character CAMEO code of the CAMEO “type” or “role” of Actor1, if specified.  This can be a specific role such as Police Forces, Government, Military, Political Opposition, Rebels, etc, a broad role class such as Education, Elites, Media, Refugees, or organizational classes like Non-Governmental Movement.  Special codes such as Moderate and Radical may refer to the operational strategy of a group."
a1_type1_desc,"Type description 1 after matched using cameo code"
a1_type2_code,"If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this returns the second code."

a1_geo_id,"This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and holds one of the following values:  1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state).  This can be used to filter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping.  Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank."

is_root_event,"The system codes every event found in an entire document, using an array of techniques to deference and link information together.  A number of previous projects such as the ICEWS initiative have found that events occurring in the lead paragraph of a document tend to be the most “important.”  This flag can therefore be used as a proxy for the rough importance of an event to create subsets of the event stream.  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table."
ev_code,"This is the raw CAMEO action code describing the action that Actor1 performed upon Actor2.  NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a string instead of an integer, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make distinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer."
ev_desc,"ev_code matched"
ev_base_code,"CAMEO event codes are defined in a three-level taxonomy.  For events at level three in the taxonomy, this yields its level two leaf root node.  For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) would yield an EventBaseCode of “025” (“Appeal to yield”).  This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity.  For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode.  NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a  instead of an integer, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make distinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer."
ev_base_desc,"ev_base_code matched"
ev_root_code,"Similar to EventBaseCode, this defines the root-level category the event code falls under.  For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) has a root code of “02” (“Appeal”).  This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity.  For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode.  NOTE: it is strongly recommended that this field be stored as a  instead of an integer, since the CAMEO taxonomy can include zero-leaded event codes that can make distinguishing between certain event types more difficult when stored as an integer."
ev_root_desc,"ev_root_code matched"
quad_class,"The entire CAMEO event taxonomy is ultimately organized under four primary classifications: Verbal Cooperation, Material Cooperation, Verbal Conflict, and Material Conflict.  This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the highest level of aggregation.  The numeric codes in this field map to the Quad Classes as follows: 1=Verbal Cooperation, 2=Material Cooperation, 3=Verbal Conflict, 4=Material Conflict."
quad_class_desc,"quad_class matched"
gstein_scale,"Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to +10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a country.  This is known as the Goldstein Scale.  This field specifies the Goldstein score for each event type.  NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event record being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both receive the same Goldstein score.  This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to yield an approximation of the stability of a location over time."
num_mentions,"This is the total number of mentions of this event across all source documents during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  Multiple references to an event within a single document also contribute to this count.  This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant.  The total universe of source documents and the density of events within them vary over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.  This field is actually a composite score of the total number of raw mentions and the number of mentions extracted from reprocessed versions of each article (see the discussion for the Mentions table).   NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table."
num_sources,"This is the total number of information sources containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant.  The total universe of sources varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news reports.

avg_tone,"This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.  The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive).  Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral.  This can be used as a method of filtering the “context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the “impact” of that event.  For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence.  A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).  NOTE: this field refers only to the first news report to mention an event and is not updated if the event is found in a different context in other news reports.  It is included for legacy purposes – for more precise information on the positioning of an event, see the Mentions table.  NOTE: this provides only a basic tonal assessment of an article and it is recommended that users interested in emotional measures use the Mentions and Global Knowledge Graph tables to merge the complete set of 2,300 emotions and themes from the GKG GCAM system into their analysis of event records."
date_added,"This field stores the date the event was added to the master database in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format in the UTC timezone.  For those needing to access events at 15 minute resolution, this is the field that should be used in queries."
source_url,"This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in.  In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and flow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first report, but is at least in the first few reports."
