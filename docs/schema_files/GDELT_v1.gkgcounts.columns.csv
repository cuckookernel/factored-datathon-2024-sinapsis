column,col_renamed,data_type,description
DATE,pub_date,INTEGER,"This is the date in YYYYMMDD format on which the news media used to construct this GKG file was published. NOTE that unlike the main GDELT event stream files, this date is the date of publication of the news media from which the information was extracted – if the article discusses events in the past, the date is NOT time-shifted as it is for the GDELT event stream. This date will be the same for all rows in a file and is redundant from a data processing standpoint, but is provided to make it easier to load GKG files directly into an SQL database for analysis."
NUMARTS,num_articles,INTEGER,"This is the total number of source documents containing one or more mentions of this count. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an count: the more discussion of that count, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of source documents varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of counts during the time period of interest."
COUNTTYPE,count_type,STRING,"This is the value of the NAME field from the Category List spreadsheet indicating which category this count is of. At the time of this writing, this is most often AFFECT, ARREST, KIDNAP, KILL, PROTEST, SEIZE, or WOUND, though other categories may appear here as well in certain circumstances when they appear in context with one of these categories, or as other Count categories are added over time. A value o"
NUMBER,reported_count,FLOAT,"This is the actual count being reported. If CountType is “PROTEST” and Number is 126, this means that the source article(s) contained a mention of 126 protesters"
OBJECTTYPE,object_type,STRING,"This records any identifying information as to what the number refers to. For example, a mention of “20 Christian missionaries were arrested” will result in “Christian missionaries” being captured here. This field will be blank in cases where no identifying information could be identified."
GEO_TYPE,geo_type,INTEGER,"This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and holds one of the following values: 1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state). This can be used to filter counts by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those counts with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping. Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank."
GEO_FULLNAME,geo_full_name,STRING,"This is the full human-readable name of the matched location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states it is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when placing counts on a map. NOTE: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same place."
GEO_COUNTRYCODE,geo_country_code,STRING,"This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the location."
GEO_ADM1CODE,geo_adm1_code,STRING,"This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by the 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative division housing the landmark. In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the state’s name (such as “TX” for Texas)."
GEO_LAT,geo_lat,FLOAT,This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping.
GEO_LONG,geo_lon,FLOAT,This is the centroid longitude of the landmark for mapping.
GEO_FEATUREID,geo_feat_id,STRING,"This is the GNS or GNIS FeatureID for this location. More information on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012).3 NOTE: This field will be blank or contain a country code, state code, or FIPS code, except when Actor1Geo_Type has a value of 3 or 4. NOTE: This field can c"
CAMEOEVENTIDS,event_ids,STRING,"This field contains a comma-separated list of GlobalEventIDs from the master GDELT event stream of events that were found in the same article(s) as this count was found. This can be used, for example, to associate any protest events from the primary GDELT event database with any “PROTEST” counts found in the same articles to compile a basic measure of how many protesters were involved with the protest. This is useful in that the GDELT event record for the protest encodes many other variables, such as the specific actors involved and their attributes, while the Count record only records that a certain number of protesters were mentioned in an article. The same GlobalEventID may appear in multiple entries if multiple counts were found in the same article mentioning that event or if that event was mentioned in multiple news articles with different counts (reflecting conflicting or evolving information on the details of the event)."
SOURCES,sources,STRING,"This is a semicolon-delimited list of all of the sources publishing articles mentioning this count. For web-based news material, this is the top-level domain the page was from, while for BBC Monitoring service material, “BBC Monitoring” will appear. Thus, it is important to note that this field will contain a mixture of domain names and the phrase “BBC Monitoring”."
SOURCEURLS,source_urls,STRING,"This is a delimited list of ALL articles mentioning this count. Since URLs can contain a wide variety of characters the phrase “<UDIV>” is used as the delimiter between articles. For web-based news material, this will be the complete URL to the article, while for BBC Monitoring service material, “BBC Monitoring” will appear. Thus, it is important to note that this field will contain a mixture of URLs and the phrase “BBC Monitoring”. It is alsoimportant to note that this field contains a list of ALL source articles, unlike the primary GDELT event stream, which only lists the first source article mentioning an event in the case an event is mentioned in multiple articles.
